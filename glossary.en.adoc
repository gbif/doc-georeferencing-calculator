[[accuracy]]accuracy:: the closeness of an estimated value (for example, measured or computed) to a standard or accepted ("true") value. Antonym: inaccuracy Compare <<error>>, <<bias>>, <<precision>>, <<false precision>> and <<uncertainty>>.
+
NOTE: "the true value is not known, but only estimated, the accuracy of the measured quantity is also unknown. Therefore, accuracy of coordinate information can only be estimated." (Geodetic Survey Division 1996, https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/accuracy/part3/chapter3[FGDC 1998^]).

[[altitude]]altitude:: a measurement of the vertical distance above a <<vertical datum>>, usually <<mean sea level>> or <<geoid>>. For points on the surface of the earth, altitude is synonymous with <<elevation>>.

[[coordinate-format]]coordinate format:: the format in which <<coordinates>> are encoded, such as "<<decimal degrees>>", "<<DMS,degrees minutes seconds>>", "degrees decimal minutes", or <<UTM>>.

[[coordinate-precision]]coordinate precision:: the fraction of a degree corresponding to the number of significant digits in the source <<coordinates>>. For example, if the coordinates are reported to the nearest minute, the <<precision>> is 1/3600th (0.00027778) of a degree; if a <<decimal-degrees,decimal degree>> is reported to two decimal places, the precision is 0.01 of a degree.

[[coordinate-reference-system]]coordinate reference system:: (also <<spatial reference system>>) a <<coordinate system>> defined in relation to a standard reference or <<datum>>.

[[coordinate-system]]coordinate system:: a geometric system that defines the nature and relationship of the <<coordinates>> it uses to uniquely define positions. Examples include the <<geographic coordinate system>> and the <<UTM>> coordinate system.

[[coordinates]]coordinates:: a set of values that define a position within a <<coordinate system>>. Coordinates are used to represent <<location,locations>> in space relative to other locations.

[[coordinateUncertaintyInMeters]]coordinateUncertaintyInMeters:: the <<Darwin Core>> term corresponding to the <<maximum uncertainty distance>> when given in meters.

[[corrected-center]]corrected center:: the point within a <<location>>, or on its <<boundary>>, that minimizes the <<geographic radial>> of the location. This point is obtained by making the <<smallest enclosing circle>> that contains the entire <<feature>>, and then taking the center of that circle. If that center does not fall inside the boundaries of the feature, make the <<smallest enclosing circle>> that has its center on the boundary of the feature. Note that in the second case, the new circle, and hence the <<radial>>, will always be larger than the uncorrected one (see xref:img-polygon-center[xrefstyle="short"]).

[[Darwin-Core]]Darwin Core:: is a standard for exchanging information about biological diversity (see https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/[Darwin Core]).

[[datum]]datum:: a set of one or more parameters that serve as a reference or basis for the calculation of other parameters [ISO 19111]. A datum defines the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of the axes of a <<coordinate system>>. For <<georeference,georeferencing>> purposes, a *datum* may be a <<geodetic datum>> or a <<vertical datum>>.

[[decimal-degrees]]decimal degrees:: degrees expressed as a single real number (e.g. −22.343456). Note that <<latitude,latitudes>> south of the equator are negative, as are <<longitude,longitudes>> west of the <<prime meridian>> to −180 degrees. See also <<decimal latitude>> and <<decimal longitude>>.

[[ellipsoid]]ellipsoid:: a three-dimensional, closed geometric <<shape>>, all planar sections of which are ellipses or circles. An ellipsoid has three independent axes. If an ellipsoid is made by rotating an ellipse about one of its axes, then two axes of the ellipsoid are the same, and it is called an ellipsoid of revolution. When used to represent a model of the earth, the ellipsoid is an oblate ellipsoid of revolution made by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis.

[[entry-point]]entry point:: {marine} the entry point on the surface of the ocean or lake where a diver enters the water and from which all activities are measured. See xref:img-underwater-event[xrefstyle="short"].

[[EPSG]]EPSG:: EPSG codes are defined by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, using a spatial reference identifier (SRID) to reference <<spatial reference system,spatial reference systems>>. The EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset (http://www.epsg.org/[IOPG 2019^]) is a collection of definitions of <<coordinate reference system,coordinate reference systems>> (including <<datum,datums>>) and <<coordinates,coordinate>> transformations which may be global, regional, national or local in application.

[[error]]error:: the difference between a computed, estimated, or measured value and the accepted true, specified, or theoretically correct value. It encompasses both the <<precision,imprecision>> of a measurement and its inaccuracies. Error can be either random or systematic. If the error is systematic, it is called "<<bias>>". Compare <<accuracy>>, <<bias>>, <<precision>>, <<false precision>> and <<uncertainty>>.

[[feature]]feature:: an object of observation, measurement, or reference that can be represented spatially. Often categorized into "*feature types*" (e.g. mountain, road, populated place, etc.) and given names for specific instances (e.g. "Mount Everest", "Ruta 40", "Istanbul"), which are also sometimes referred to as "named places", "place names" or "toponyms".

[[gazetteer]]gazetteer:: an index of geographical <<feature,features>> and their <<location,locations>>, often with <<geographic coordinates>>.

[[geographic-boundary]]geographic boundary:: the representation in <<geographic coordinates>> of a vertical projection of a <<boundary>> onto a model of the surface of the earth.

[[geographic-center]]geographic center:: the midpoint of the extremes of <<latitude>> and <<longitude>> of a <<feature>>. *Geographic centers* are relatively easy to determine, but they generally do not correspond to the center obtained by a least circumscribing circle. For that reason it is not recommended to use a *geographic center* for any application in <<georeference,georeferencing>>. Compare <<corrected center>>.

[[geographic-component]]geographic component:: the part of a description of a <<location>> that consists of <<geographic coordinates>> and associated <<uncertainty>>. Non-geographic components of a location description include <<elevation>>, <<depth>>, and <<distance above surface>>.

[[geographic-coordinate-reference-system]]geographic coordinate reference system:: a <<geodetic coordinate reference system>> that uses <<geographic coordinates>>.

[[geographic-coordinates]]geographic coordinates:: a measurement of a <<location>> on the earth's surface expressed as <<latitude>> and <<longitude>>.

[[geographic-radial]]geographic radial:: the distance from the <<corrected center>> of a <<location>> to the furthest point on the <<geographic boundary>> of that location. The geographical radial is what contributes to calculations of the <<maximum uncertainty distance>> using the <<point-radius>> <<georeferencing method>>. The term *geographic radial,* as defined here, replaces its equivalent "extent" used in the early versions of these Best Practices and related documents, including the {gqg}[Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide (Wieczorek et al. 2012a)^] and versions of the {gcm}[Georeferencing Calculator] (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2018)^] and its https://doi.org/10.35035/gdwq-3v93[Manual for the Georeferencing Calculator (Wieczorek & Bloom 2015)] before 2019, while the new definition of <<extent>> as found in this document remains more in keeping with common usage and understanding and has also been updated in the latest versions of the {gqg}[Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide (Zermoglio et al. 2020)^] and the https://doi.org/10.35035/gdwq-3v93[Georeferencing Calculator Manual (Bloom et al. 2020)^].

[[geoid]]geoid:: a global equipotential surface that approximates <<mean sea level>>. This surface is everywhere perpendicular to the force of gravity (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-5826-8[Loweth 1997^]).

[[geometry]]geometry:: the measures and properties of points, lines, and surfaces. **Geometry** is used to represent the <<geographic component>> of <<location,locations>>.

[[georeference]]georeference:: the process (verb) or product (noun) of interpreting a <<locality>> description into a spatially mappable representation using a <<georeferencing method>>. Compare with <<geocode>>. The usage here is distinct from the concept of georeferencing satellite and other imagery (known as georectification).

[[georeferencing-protocol]]georeferencing protocol:: the documented specific steps to apply to a <<locality>>, based on the <<locality type>>, to produce a particular type of spatial representation.

GIS:: _see_ <<geographic-information-system>>.

[[GNSS]]GNSS:: Global Navigation Satellite System, the generic term for satellite navigation systems that provide global autonomous geo-spatial positioning. This term encompasses <<GPS>>, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou and other regional systems.

[[GPS]]GPS:: Global Positioning System, a satellite-based system used for determining positions on or near the earth. Orbiting satellites transmit radio signals that allow a receiver to calculate its own <<location>> as <<coordinates>> and <<elevation>>, sometimes with <<accuracy>> estimates. A **GPS** or <<GNSS>> Receiver (including those in smartphones and cameras) is the instrument that receives the radio signals and translates them into <<geographic coordinates>>. See also <<GNSS>> of which **GPS** is one example.

[[heading]]heading:: compass direction such as east or northwest, or sometimes given as degrees clockwise from north. Usually used in conjunction with <<offset>> to give a distance and direction from a <<feature>>.

[[latitude]]latitude:: the angular distance of a point north or south of the equator.

[[locality]]locality:: the verbal representation of a <<location>>, also sometimes called _*locality* description_.

[[locality-type]]locality type:: a category applied to a <<locality clause>> that determines the specific <<georeferencing method>> that should be applied.

[[location]]location:: a physical space that can be positioned and oriented relative to a reference point, and potentially described in a natural language <<locality>> description. In <<georeference,georeferencing>>, a **location** can have distinct representations based on distinct <<rules of interpretation>>, each of which is embodied in a <<georeferencing method>>.

// Two terms already in UI 'glossary'
[[longitude]]longitude:: the angular distance of a point east or west of a <<prime meridian>> at a given <<latitude>>.

[[offset]]offset:: a displacement from a reference <<location>>. Usually used in conjunction with <<heading>> to give a distance and <<direction>> from a <<feature>>.

[[PID]]PID:: a Persistent Identifier is a long-lasting reference to a document, file, web page, or other object. The term "persistent identifier" is usually used in the context of digital objects that are accessible over the Internet. There are many options for PIDs, such as <<GUID,Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs)>>, https://www.doi.org[Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)^], and Universal Unique Identifiers (UUIDs).

// lots of cross-refs that might not carry over. Text includes links to external references
[[point-radius]]point-radius:: a representation of the <<geographic component>> of a <<location>> as a <<geographic-coordinates,geographic coordinate>> and a <<maximum uncertainty distance>>. The <<point-radius>> <<georeferencing method>> produces <<georeference,georeferences>> that include geographic coordinates, a <<coordinate reference system>>, and a maximum uncertainty distance that encompasses all of the possible geographic coordinates where a <<locality>> might be interpreted to be. This representation encompasses all of the geographical <<uncertainty,uncertainties>> within a circle. The point-radius method uses ranges to represent the non-geographic descriptors of the location (<<elevation>>, <<depth>>, <<distance above surface>>).

[[precision]]precision::
+
--
1. the closeness of a repeated set of observations of the same quantity to one another – a measure of control over random <<error>>.
2. with values, it describes the finest unit of measurement used to express that value (e.g. if a record is reported to the nearest second, the precision is 1/3600^th^ of a degree; if a <<decimal degrees,decimal degree>> is reported to two decimal places, the precision is 0.01 of a degree).
--
+
Antonym: imprecision. Compare <<accuracy>>, <<error>>, <<bias>>, <<false precision>>, and <<uncertainty>>.

[[prime-meridian]]prime meridian:: the set of <<location,locations>> with <<longitude>> designated as 0 degrees east and west, to which all other longitudes are referenced. The Greenwich <<meridian>> is internationally recognized as the <<prime meridian>> for many popular and official purposes.

[[radial]]radial:: the distance from a center point (e.g. the <<corrected center,corrected>> or <<geographic center>>) within a <<location>> to the furthest point on the outermost <<boundary>> of that <<location>>. See also <<geographic radial>>.

[[smallest-enclosing-circle]]smallest enclosing circle:: a circle with the smallest radius (<<radial>>) that contains all of a given set of points (or a given <<shape>>) on a surface (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest-circle_problem[_Smallest-circle problem_]). This is seldom the same as the <<geographic center>>, nor the midpoint between two most distant <<geographic coordinates>> of a <<location>>.

[[uncertainty]]uncertainty:: a measure of the incompleteness of one’s knowledge or information about an unknown quantity whose true value could be established if complete knowledge and a perfect measuring device were available (<<cullen,Cullen & Frey 1999>>). <<georeferencing method,Georeferencing methods>> codify how to incorporate uncertainties from a variety of sources (including <<accuracy>> and <<precision>>) in the interpretation of a <<location>>. Compare <<accuracy>>, <<error>>, <<bias>>, <<precision>>, and <<false precision>>.

[[UTM]]UTM:: Universal Transverse Mercator, a standardized <<coordinate system>> based on a metric rectangular <<grid>> system and a division of the earth into sixty 6-degree longitudinal zones. The scope of **UTM** covers from 84° N to 80° S. (See <<Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Coordinates>>).

[[WGS84]]WGS84:: World Geodetic System 1984, a popular globally-used horizontal <<geodetic coordinate reference system>> (EPSG:4326) upon which raw <<GPS>> measurements are based (though a GPS receiver is capable of delivering <<coordinates>> in other reference systems). The term is also commonly used for the <<geodetic datum>> used by that system and for the <<ellipsoid>> (EPSG:7030) upon which that <<datum>> (EPSG:6326) is based.
