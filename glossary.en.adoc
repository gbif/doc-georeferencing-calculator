This glossary explains the user interface elements of the *_Calculator_* and how they relate to the underlying calculations.

[glossary]
[[Calculate]]Calculate:: Button used to calculate *coordinates* and *uncertainty* using the *point-radius method* (Wieczorek _et al._ 2004), based on the values of parameters pertinent to the selected _Locality Type_. Clicking on the *_Calculate_* button fills in the results section of the *_Calculator_* formatted as *Darwin Core* fields that need to be recorded for a *georeference* that follows the *_Georeferencing Best Practices_* (_i.e._, *_decimalLatitude_*, *_decimalLongitude_*, *_geodeticDatum_*, *_coordinateUncertaintyInMeters_*, *_coordinatePrecision_*, *_georeferencedBy_*, *_georeferencedDate_*, and *_georeferenceProtocol_*). The calculation combines the sources of *uncertainty* using an algorithm appropriate to the *locality type* (see {gbp}#calculating-uncertainties[Calculating Uncertainties] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*). The calculations account for *uncertainties* due to *coordinate precision*, unknown *datum*, data source, *GPS* *error*, measurement *error*, *feature geographic radial*, distance *precision*, and *heading* *precision*.

[[Coordinate-Format]]Coordinate Format:: Defines the original *geographic coordinate format* (*decimal degrees*, degrees minutes seconds, degrees decimal minutes) of the *coordinate* source. Equivalent to the *Darwin Core* term *_verbatimCoordinateSystem_*. Selecting the original _Coordinate Format_ allows the *coordinates* to be entered in their native format and forces the *_Calculator_* to present appropriate options for _Coordinate Precision_. Note that changing the _Coordinate Format_ will reset the _Coordinate Precision_ value to "_nearest degree_". Be sure to correct this for the actual *coordinate precision*. Behind the scenes, the *_Calculator_* stores *coordinates* in *decimal degrees* to seven decimal places. This is to preserve the correct *coordinates* in all formats regardless of how many transformations are done.

[[Coordinate-Precision-input]]Coordinate Precision (input):: Labeled as _Precision_ in the first column of input parameters, this drop-down list is populated with levels of *precision* in keeping with the _Coordinate Format_ chosen for the verbatim original *coordinates*. This is similar to, but *NOT* the same as the *Darwin Core* term *_coordinatePrecision_*, which applies to the output *coordinates*. A value of "_exact_" is any level of *precision* higher than the otherwise highest *precision* given on the list.

[[Coordinate-Precision-output]]Coordinate Precision (output):: Labeled as _Precision_ in the results, this text box is populated with *precision* of the output *coordinates*, and as such is equivalent to the *Darwin Core* term *_coordinatePrecision_*. The *precision* of the output in the *_Calculator_* is always "_0.0000001_", no matter how many digits appear to the right of the decimal indicator in the _Output Latitude_ and _Output Longitude_.

[[Coordinate-Source]]Coordinate Source:: The resources (map, *GPS*, *gazetteer*, *locality* description) from which the _Input Latitude_ and _Longitude_ were derived. Related to, but *NOT* the same as the *Darwin Core* term *_georeferenceSources_*, which requires the specific resources used rather than their characteristics. Note that the *uncertainties* from the two sources "_gazetteer_" and "_locality description_" can not be anticipated universally, and therefore do not contribute to the *uncertainty* in the calculations. If the *error* characteristics of the specific sources of this type are known, they can be added in the _Measurement Error_ before calculating. If the source "_GPS_" is selected, the label for _Measurement Error_ will change to _GPS Accuracy_, which is where *accuracy* distance of the *GPS* at the time the *coordinates* were taken should be entered. For details on _GPS Accuracy_ see {gbp}using-a-gps[Using a GPS] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*.

[[Datum]]Datum:: Defines the position of the origin and orientation of an *ellipsoid* upon which the *coordinates* are based for the given _Coordinate Source_. Equivalent to the *Darwin Core* term *_geodeticDatum_*. The *_Calculator_* includes *ellipsoids* on the _Datum_ drop-down list, as sometimes that is all that *coordinate* source shows. The choice of _Datum_ has two important effects. The first is the contribution to *uncertainty* if the *datum* of the source *coordinates* is not known. If the *datum* and *ellipsoid* are not known, choose the option "_datum not recorded_". _Uncertainty_ due to an unknown *datum* can be severe and varies geographically in a complex way, with a worst-case contribution of 5359 m (see {gbp}#coordinate-reference-system[Coordinate Reference System] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*. The second important effect of the _Datum_ selection is to provide the characteristics of the *ellipsoid* model of the earth, which the distance calculations depend on.

[[Direction]]Direction:: The *heading* given in the *locality* description, either as a standard compass point (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_the_compass[_Boxing the compass_]) or as a number of degrees in the clockwise direction from north. If "_degrees from N_" is selected, there will appear a text box to the right of it in which to enter the degree *heading*.

NOTE: Some marine locality descriptions reference a direction to a landmark (azimuth) rather than a heading from the current location, for example, "327° to Nubble Lighthouse". To make an offset at a heading calculation for such a locality description, use the compass point 180 degrees from the one given in the locality description (147° in the example above) as the *Direction*.

[[Distance-Precision]]Distance Precision:: Labeled as _Precision_ in the second column of input parameters. Refers to the *precision* with which a distance was described in a *locality* (see {gbp}#uncertainty-related-to-offset-precision[Uncertainty Related to Offset Precision] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_*). This drop-down list is populated in keeping with the _Distance Units_ chosen and contains powers of ten and simple fractions to indicate the *precision* demonstrated in the verbatim original *offset*.

[[Distance-Units]]Distance Units:: Denotes the real world units used in the *locality* description. It is important to select the original units as given in the description, because this is needed to properly incorporate the *uncertainty* from distance *precision*.

[[Go-here]]Go here:: Button used to copy and potentially convert the calculated *coordinates* from the _Output Latitude_ and _Output Longitude_ into the _Input Latitude_ and _Input Longitude_ fields in preparation for a new calculation based on the previous results, eliminating the need to copy manually or to use cut and paste keyboard combinations.

[[GPS-Accuracy]]GPS Accuracy:: When "_GPS_" is selected from the _Coordinate Source_ drop-down list, the label for the _Measurement Error_ text box changes to _GPS Accuracy_. Enter the value given by the *GPS* at the time the *coordinates* were captured. If not known, enter 100 m for standard hand-held *GPS* coordinates taken before 1 May 2000 when Selective Availability was discontinued. After that, use 30 m as a default value.

[[Language]]Language:: The *_Calculator_* may be used in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, or Dutch. The language can be changed using the _Language_ drop-down in the upper left-hand corner of the *_Calculator_*. Regardless of the language chosen, the *_Calculator_* always uses a period ('.') as the decimal separator. If you would like to contribute labels for another language, please submit an issue to the *_Calculator_* https://github.com/VertNet/georefcalculator/issues[GitHub repository].

[[Latitude-input]]Latitude (input)::  The *geographic coordinate* north or south of the Equator (where *latitude* is 0) for the point of reference for the calculation, which is determined by the specific *locality type*. *Latitudes* north of the Equator are positive by convention, while *latitudes* to the south are negative. The minus sign ("−") should be included as appropriate. The *_Calculator_* supports degree-based *geographic coordinate formats* for *latitude* and *longitude*: *decimal degrees* (_e.g._, 35.3733333), degrees decimal minutes (_e.g._, 35° 22.4′ N) and degrees minutes seconds (_e.g._, 35° 22′ 24″ N).

[[Latitude-output]]Latitude (output)::  The resulting *latitude* for a given calculation, in *decimal degrees*. Equivalent to the *Darwin Core* term *_decimalLatitude_*. See also, *Latitude* (input).

[[Locality-Type]]Locality Type:: The pattern of the most specific part of a *locality* description to be *georeferenced*. The *_Calculator_* can compute *georeferences* for six basic *locality types*: _Coordinates only_, _Geographic feature only_, _Distance only_, _Distance along a path_, _Distance along orthogonal directions_, and _Distance at a heading_. Selecting a _Locality Type_ will configure the *_Calculator_* to show all of the parameters that need to be set or chosen in order to do the *georeference* calculation. The {gqg}[*_Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide_*] gives specific instructions for how to set the parameters for different examples of each of the *locality types*.

[[Longitude-input]]Longitude (input)::  The *geographic coordinate* east or west of the *prime meridian* (an arc between the north and south poles where *longitude* is 0) for the point of reference for the calculation, which is determined by the specific *locality type*. *Longitudes* east of the *prime meridian* are positive by convention, while *longitudes* to the west are negative. The minus sign ("−") should be included as appropriate. The *_Calculator_* supports degree-based *geographic coordinate formats* for *latitude* and *longitude*: *decimal degrees* (−105.3733333), degrees decimal minutes (105° 22.4′ W), and degrees minutes seconds (105° 22′ 24″ W), .

[[Longitude-output]]Longitude (output)::  The resulting *longitude* for a given calculation in *decimal degrees*. Equivalent to the *Darwin Core* term *_decimalLongitude_*. See also, *Longitude* (input).

[[Measurement-Error]]Measurement Error:: Accounts for *error* associated with the ability to distinguish one point from another using any measuring tool, such as rulers on paper maps or the measuring tools on Google™ Maps or Google™ Earth. The units of the measurement must be the same as those for the *locality* description. The _Distance Converter_ at the bottom of the *_Calculator_* is provided to aid in changing a measurement to the *locality* description units.

NOTE: If more than one measurement is made in the course of a georeference determination, enter the sum of all the measurement errors.

[[Offset-Distance]]Offset Distance:: The linear distance from a point of origin. *Offsets* are used for the _Locality Types_ "_Distance at a heading_" and "_Distance only_". If the _Locality Type_ "_Distance in orthogonal directions_" is selected, there are two distinct *offsets*:
+
--
North or South Offset Distance:: The distance to the north or south of the _Input Latitude_.
East or West Offset Distance:: The distance to the east or west of the _Input Longitude_.
--

[[Radial-of-Feature]]Radial of Feature:: The *feature* is the place in the *locality* description that corresponds to the _Input Latitude_ and _Longitude_. Types of *features* vary widely and include, for example, populated places, street addresses, junctions, crossings, lakes, mountains, parks, islands, etc. The *geographic radial* of the *feature* is the distance from the *corrected center* of the *feature* to the furthest point on the *geographic boundary* of that *feature* (see {gbp}#extent-of-a-location[Extent of a Location] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_* and {gqg}#radial-of-feature[Radial of Feature] in *_Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide_*).

[[Uncertainty]]Uncertainty (m):: The resulting combination of all sources of *uncertainty* (*coordinate precision*, unknown *datum*, data source, *GPS accuracy*, measurement *error*, *feature geographic radial*, distance *precision*, and *heading precision*) expressed as a linear distance – the radius in the *point-radius method* (Wieczorek _et al._ 2004). Along with the _Output Latitude_, _Output Longitude_, and _Datum_, the radius defines a *smallest encompassing circle* containing all of the possible places a *locality* description could mean.

[[Version]]Version:: Displayed in the bottom left-hand corner of the *_Calculator_* in the format yyyymmddll, where ll is the two-letter language code of the interface.
