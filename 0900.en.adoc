== Understanding uncertainty contributions

The *_Calculator_* is an excellent tool for investigating the contributions to *uncertainty* from distinct sources. For any given _Locality Type_, one can nullify all but one source of *uncertainty* to see what the contribution to overall *uncertainty* is from that source. For example, to see what the contribution to overall *uncertainty* is from an unknown *datum* at a given *location*, choose the "_Coordinate only_" _Locality Type_, set the _Input Latitude_ and _Longitude_ to the place that needs to be checked, set the _Coordinate Source_ to "_gazetteer_" or "_locality description_" (because neither of these choices contributes an *uncertainty* to the calculation), select "_datum not recorded_" from the _Datum_ drop-down list, select "_exact_" from the _Coordinate Precision_ drop-down list, set the _Measurement Error_ to "_0_". With these settings, the only source of *uncertainty* is the unknown *datum*. At the *coordinate* 0,0, the calculated *uncertainty* is 5030m, as shown in xref:img-isolating-uncertainty[xrefstyle="short"]. This large *uncertainty* reflects the maximum distance between the point 0,0 in any *geographic coordinate reference system* and the point 0,0 in the *coordinate reference system* *WGS84*. See {gbp}#coordinate-reference-system[Coordinate Reference System] in *_Georeferencing Best Practices_* for further discussion on the subject.
