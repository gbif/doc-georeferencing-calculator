== Understanding uncertainty contributions

The http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator^] is an excellent tool for investigating the contributions to <<uncertainty>> from distinct sources. For any given xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element], one can nullify all but one source of uncertainty to see what the contribution to overall uncertainty is from that source. For example, to see what the contribution to overall uncertainty is from an unknown <<datum>> at a given <<location>>, choose the "Coordinate only" xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element], set the xref:ui-input-latitude[role=ui-element] and xref:ui-input-longitude[role=ui-element] to the place that needs to be checked, set the xref:ui-coordinate-source[role=ui-element] to "gazetteer" or "locality description" (because neither of these choices contributes an uncertainty to the calculation), select "datum not recorded" from the xref:ui-datum[role=ui-element] drop-down list, select "exact" from the xref:ui-input-coordinate-precision[role=ui-element] drop-down list, set the xref:ui-measurement-error[role=ui-element] to "0". With these settings, the only source of uncertainty is the unknown datum. At the coordinate 0,0, the calculated uncertainty is 5030m, as shown in xref:img-isolating-uncertainty[xrefstyle="short"]. This large uncertainty reflects the maximum distance between the point 0,0 in any <<geographic-coordinate-reference-system>> and the point 0,0 in the coordinate reference system <<WGS84>>. See {gbp}#coordinate-reference-system[Coordinate Reference System^] in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^] for further discussion on the subject.
