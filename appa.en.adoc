== Appendix A: UI components and how they relate to calculations

[[ui-calculate]]Calculate:: Button used to calculate <<coordinates>> and <<uncertainty>> using the <<point-radius>> <<georeferencing-method,method>> (https://doi.org/10.1080/13658810412331280211[Wieczorek et al. 2004^]), based on the values of parameters pertinent to the selected xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element]. Clicking on the xref:ui-calculate[role=ui-element] button fills in the results section of the Calculator formatted as <<Darwin-Core>> fields that need to be recorded for a <<georeference>> that follows the {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^] (i.e. term:dwc[decimalLatitude], term:dwc[decimalLongitude], term:dwc[geodeticDatum], term:dwc[coordinateUncertaintyInMeters], term:dwc[coordinatePrecision], term:dwc[georeferencedBy], term:dwc[georeferencedDate], and term:dwc[georeferenceProtocol]). The calculation combines the sources of uncertainty using an algorithm appropriate to the <<locality-type>> (see {gbp}#calculating-uncertainties[Calculating Uncertainties^] in Georeferencing Best Practices). The calculations account for <<uncertainty,uncertainties>> due to <<coordinate-precision>>, unknown <<datum>>, data source, <<GPS>> <<error>>, measurement error, <<feature>> <<geographic-radial>>, distance <<precision>>, and <<heading>> precision.

[[ui-coordinate-format]]Coordinate Format:: Defines the original <<geographic-coordinates,geographic coordinate>> format (<<decimal-degrees>>, degrees minutes seconds, degrees decimal minutes) of the <<coordinates,coordinate>> source. Equivalent to the <<Darwin-Core>> term term:dwc[verbatimCoordinateSystem]. Selecting the original xref:ui-coordinate-format[role=ui-element] allows the coordinates to be entered in their native format and forces the Calculator to present appropriate options for xref:ui-input-coordinate-precision[role=ui-element]. Note that changing the xref:ui-coordinate-format[role=ui-element] will reset the xref:ui-input-coordinate-precision[role=ui-element] value to "nearest degree". Be sure to correct this for the actual <<coordinate-precision>>. Behind the scenes, the Calculator stores coordinates in decimal degrees to seven decimal places. This is to preserve the correct coordinates in all formats regardless of how many transformations are done.

[[ui-input-coordinate-precision,Coordinate Precision]]Coordinate Precision (input):: Labeled as _Precision_ in the first column of input parameters, this drop-down list is populated with levels of <<precision>> in keeping with the xref:ui-coordinate-format[role=ui-element] chosen for the verbatim original <<coordinates>>. This is similar to, but *NOT* the same as the <<Darwin-Core>> term term:dwc[coordinatePrecision], which applies to the output coordinates. A value of "[ui-element]#exact#" is any level of <<precision>> higher than the otherwise highest *precision* given on the list.

For 35° 22′ 24″, the xref:ui-input-coordinate-precision[role=ui-element] would be "nearest second".

[[ui-output-coordinate-precision,Coordinate Precision]]Coordinate Precision (output):: Labeled as _Precision_ in the results, this text box is populated with <<precision>> of the output <<coordinates>>, and as such is equivalent to the <<Darwin-Core>> term term:dwc[coordinatePrecision]. The precision of the output in the Calculator is always "0.0000001", no matter how many digits appear to the right of the decimal indicator in the xref:ui-output-latitude[role=ui-element] and xref:ui-output-longitude[role=ui-element].

[[ui-coordinate-source]]Coordinate Source:: The resources (map, <<GPS>>, <<gazetteer>>, <<locality>> description) from which the xref:ui-input-latitude[role=ui-element] and xref:ui-input-longitude[role=ui-element] were derived. Related to, but *NOT* the same as the <<Darwin-Core>> term term:dwc[georeferenceSources], which requires the specific resources used rather than their characteristics. Note that the <<uncertainty,uncertainties>> from the two sources "_gazetteer_" and "_locality description_" can not be anticipated universally, and therefore do not contribute to the uncertainty in the calculations. If the <<error>> characteristics of the specific sources of this type are known, they can be added in the xref:ui-measurement-error[role=ui-element] before calculating. If the source "_GPS_" is selected, the label for xref:ui-measurement-error[role=ui-element] will change to xref:ui-gps-accuracy[role=ui-element], which is where <<accuracy>> distance of the <<GPS>> at the time the <<coordinates>> were taken should be entered. For details on xref:ui-gps-accuracy[role=ui-element] see {gbp}using-a-gps[Using a GPS^] in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^].

[[ui-datum]]Datum:: Defines the position of the origin and orientation of an <<ellipsoid>> upon which the <<coordinates>> are based for the given xref:ui-coordinate-source[role=ui-element]. Equivalent to the <<Darwin-Core>> term term:dwc[geodeticDatum]. The Calculator includes ellipsoids on the xref:ui-datum[role=ui-element] drop-down list, as sometimes that is all that coordinate source shows. The choice of xref:ui-datum[role=ui-element] has two important effects. The first is the contribution to <<uncertainty>> if the <<datum>> of the source coordinates is not known. If the datum and ellipsoid are not known, choose the option "_datum not recorded_". _Uncertainty_ due to an unknown datum can be severe and varies geographically in a complex way, with a worst-case contribution of 5359 m (see {gbp}#coordinate-reference-system[Coordinate Reference System^] in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^]. The second important effect of the xref:ui-datum[role=ui-element] selection is to provide the characteristics of the ellipsoid model of the earth, which the distance calculations depend on.

[[ui-direction]]Direction:: The <<heading>> given in the <<locality>> description, either as a standard compass point (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_the_compass[Boxing the compass]) or as a number of degrees in the clockwise direction from north. If "_degrees from N_" is selected, there will appear a text box to the right of it in which to enter the degree heading.

NOTE: Some marine locality descriptions reference a direction to a landmark (azimuth) rather than a heading from the current location, for example, "327° to Nubble Lighthouse". To make an offset at a heading calculation for such a locality description, use the compass point 180 degrees from the one given in the locality description (147° in the example above) as the Direction.

[[ui-distance-precision]]Distance Precision:: Labeled as [ui-element]#Precision# in the second column of input parameters. Refers to the <<precision>> with which a distance was described in a <<locality>> (see {gbp}#uncertainty-related-to-offset-precision[Uncertainty Related to Offset Precision] in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^]. This drop-down list is populated in keeping with the _Distance Units_ chosen and contains powers of ten and simple fractions to indicate the precision demonstrated in the verbatim original <<offset>>.

[[ui-distance-units]]Distance Units:: Denotes the real world units used in the <<locality>> description. It is important to select the original units as given in the description, because this is needed to properly incorporate the <<uncertainty>> from distance <<precision>>.

[[ui-go-here]]Go here:: Button used to copy and potentially convert the calculated <<coordinates>> from the xref:ui-output-latitude[role=ui-element] and xref:ui-output-longitude[role=ui-element] into the xref:ui-input-latitude[role=ui-element] and xref:ui-input-longitude[role=ui-element] fields in preparation for a new calculation based on the previous results, eliminating the need to copy manually or to use cut and paste keyboard combinations.

[[ui-gps-accuracy]]GPS Accuracy:: When "_GPS_" is selected from the xref:ui-coordinate-source[role=ui-element] drop-down list, the label for the xref:ui-measurement-error[role=ui-element] text box changes to xref:ui-gps-accuracy[role=ui-element]. Enter the value given by the <<GPS>> at the time the <<coordinates>> were captured. If not known, enter 100 m for standard hand-held GPS coordinates taken before 1 May 2000 when Selective Availability was discontinued. After that, use 30 m as a default value.

[[ui-language]]Language:: The Calculator may be used in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, or Dutch. The language can be changed using the [ui-element]#Language# drop-down in the upper left-hand corner of the Calculator. Regardless of the language chosen, the Calculator always uses a period ('.') as the decimal separator. If you would like to contribute labels for another language, please submit an issue to the Calculator https://github.com/VertNet/georefcalculator/issues[GitHub repository].

[[ui-input-latitude]]Input Latitude::  The <<geographic-coordinates,geographic coordinate>> north or south of the Equator (where <<latitude>> is 0) for the point of reference for the calculation, which is determined by the specific <<locality-type>>. <<latitude,Latitudes>> north of the Equator are positive by convention, while latitudes to the south are negative. The minus sign ("−") should be included as appropriate. The Calculator supports degree-based <<geographic-coordinates,geographic coordinate>> formats for latitude and <<longitude>>: <<decimal-degrees>> (e.g. 35.3733333), degrees decimal minutes (e.g. 35° 22.4′ N) and <<DMS,degrees-minutes-seconds>> (e.g. 35° 22′ 24″ N).

[[ui-output-latitude]]Output Latitude::  The resulting <<latitude>> for a given calculation, in <<decimal-degrees>>. Equivalent to the <<Darwin-Core>> term term:dwc[decimalLatitude]. See also, xref:ui-input-latitude[role=ui-element].

[[ui-locality-type]]Locality Type:: The pattern of the most specific part of a <<locality>> description to be <<georeference,georeferenced>>. The Calculator can compute georeferences for six basic <<locality-type,locality types>>: _Coordinates only_, _Geographic feature only_, _Distance only_, _Distance along a path_, _Distance along orthogonal directions_, and _Distance at a heading_. Selecting a xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] will configure the Calculator to show all of the parameters that need to be set or chosen in order to do the georeference calculation. The {gqg}[Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide (Zermoglio et al. 2020)^] gives specific instructions for how to set the parameters for different examples of each of the locality types.

[[ui-input-longitude]]Input Longitude:: The <<geographic-coordinates,geographic coordinate>> east or west of the <<prime-meridian>> (an arc between the north and south poles where <<longitude>> is 0) for the point of reference for the calculation, which is determined by the specific <<locality-type>>. Longitudes east of the prime meridian are positive by convention, while longitudes to the west are negative. The minus sign ("−") should be included as appropriate. The Calculator supports degree-based <<geographic-coordinates,geographic coordinate>> formats for <<latitude>> and longitude: <<decimal-degrees>> (−105.3733333), degrees decimal minutes (105° 22.4′ W), and degrees minutes seconds (105° 22′ 24″ W), .

[[ui-output-longitude]]Output Longitude:: The resulting <<longitude>> for a given calculation in <<decimal-degrees>>. Equivalent to the <<Darwin-Core>> term term:dwc[decimalLongitude]. See also, xref:ui-input-longitude[role=ui-element].

[[ui-measurement-error]]Measurement Error:: Accounts for <<error>> associated with the ability to distinguish one point from another using any measuring tool, such as rulers on paper maps or the measuring tools on Google Maps or Google Earth. The units of the measurement must be the same as those for the <<locality>> description. The _Distance Converter_ at the bottom of the Calculator is provided to aid in changing a measurement to the locality description units.

NOTE: If more than one measurement is made in the course of a georeference determination, enter the sum of all the measurement errors.

[[ui-offset-distance]]Offset Distance:: The linear distance from a point of origin. <<offset,Offsets>> are used for the _Locality Types_ "_Distance at a heading_" and "_Distance only_". If the xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] "_Distance in orthogonal directions_" is selected, there are two distinct offsets:
+
--
North or South Offset Distance:: The distance to the north or south of the xref:ui-input-latitude[role=ui-element].
East or West Offset Distance:: The distance to the east or west of the xref:ui-input-longitude[role=ui-element].
--

[[ui-radial-of-feature]]Radial of Feature:: The <<feature>> is the place in the <<locality>> description that corresponds to the xref:ui-input-latitude[role=ui-element] and xref:ui-input-longitude[role=ui-element]. Types of features vary widely and include, for example, populated places, street addresses, junctions, crossings, lakes, mountains, parks, islands, etc. The <<geographic-radial>> of the feature is the distance from the <<corrected-center>> of the feature to the furthest point on the <<geographic-boundary>> of that feature (see {gbp}#extent-of-a-location[Extent of a Location] in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^] and {gqg}#radial-of-feature[Radial of Feature] in {gqg}[Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide (Zermoglio et al. 2020)^]).

[[ui-uncertainty,Uncertainty]]Uncertainty (m):: The resulting combination of all sources of <<uncertainty>> (<<coordinate-precision>>, unknown <<datum>>, data source, <<GPS>> <<accuracy>>, measurement <<error>>, <<feature>> <<geographic-radial>>, distance <<precision>>, and <<heading>> precision) expressed as a linear distance – the radius in the <<point-radius>> <<georeferencing-method,method>> (https://doi.org/10.1080/13658810412331280211[Wieczorek et al. 2004^]). Along with the xref:ui-output-latitude[role=ui-element], xref:ui-output-longitude[role=ui-element], and xref:ui-datum[role=ui-element], the radius defines a <<smallest-enclosing-circle>> containing all of the possible places a <<locality>> description could mean.

[[ui-version]]Version:: Displayed in the bottom left-hand corner of the Calculator in the format yyyymmddll, where ll is the two-letter language code of the interface.
