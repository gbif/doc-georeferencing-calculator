== Calculating Coordinates from a Map

<<georeference,Georeferences>> for every <<locality-type>> require <<coordinates>>. For all of the locality types except "[ui-element]#Coordinates only#" and "[ui-element]#Distance along path#", the coordinates of the <<corrected-center>> of the reference <<feature>> are needed. In many cases these can be determined directly from a <<gazetteer>> or from an online tool such as Google Maps. If the coordinates of a feature need to be determined from other reference points that have coordinates on a map (such as the corners), there is a nice little trick that can be done with the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator] to determine the coordinates of the feature easily. For example, to georeference the locality "10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield", first determine the coordinates for "Bakersfield". Suppose the xref:ui-coordinate-source[role=ui-element] is the USGS Gosford 1:24,000 Quad map. Once the corrected centre of Bakersfield has been determined on the map, find a convenient spot on the map having known coordinates, such as the corner nearest to the feature. In this case, the northeast corner of the map is closest and marked with the coordinates 35° 22′ 30″ N, 119° 00′ W.

To begin the calculation, select the xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] "[ui-element]#Distance along orthogonal directions#" (because the measurement is due south and due west from the northeast corner of the map to the corrected centre of Bakersfield). Next, select "[ui-element]#degrees minutes seconds#" as the xref:ui-coordinate-format[role=ui-element]. Enter the coordinates of the known point (the northeast corner of the map, in this example) into the xref:ui-input-latitude[role=ui-element] and xref:ui-input-longitude[role=ui-element] fields (35° 22′ 30″ N, 119° 0′ 0′ W – don't neglect the hemisphere indicators). Select "[ui-element]#North American Datum 1927#" as the xref:ui-datum[role=ui-element] used by the map.

Now use a measuring tool (e.g. a ruler) to measure a) the distance between the northeast corner of the map and the line of <<latitude>> of the corrected center of Bakersfield where it meets the east edge of the map, and b) the distance between the northeast corner of the map and the line of <<longitude>> of the corrected center of Bakersfield where it meets the north edge of the map. These are the orthogonal distances to the S and W of the known point, the northeast corner of the map.

NOTE: Convert all measurements made on the maps (mm, cm, or inches) into the distance unit provided in the locality (miles, in this example). Use the [ui-element]#Scale Converter# at the bottom of the Calculator, to do this calculation (see <<converters>>).

The point we have determined to be the corrected center of Bakersfield is 8 mm south of the 35° N line of latitude and 67 mm west of the 119° W line of longitude. After the [ui-element]#Scale Converter# has been used to convert millimeters to miles, cut and paste the values for miles into the [ui-element]#Offset Distance# text boxes on the right side of the Calculator: 0.1193 should be pasted or typed into the [ui-element]#North or South Offset Distance# field, and the cardinal direction drop-down should be set to "[ui-element]#S#" (south); 0.99916 should be pasted or typed into the [ui-element]#East or West Offset Distance# field, and the cardinal direction drop-down should be set to "[ui-element]#W#" (west). The xref:ui-distance-units[role=ui-element] drop-down should display "[ui-element]#mi#" (miles), since that is the unit described in the locality. The Calculator now has all of the parameters necessary to complete the calculation and should appear as in xref:img-calculate-from-a-map[xrefstyle="short"].

Next, click the xref:ui-calculate[role=ui-element] button. The calculated coordinates (always in <<decimal-degrees>>) for the corrected center of Bakersfield are displayed in blue in the xref:ui-output-latitude[role=ui-element] and xref:ui-output-longitude[role=ui-element] fields in the results section of the Calculator, as shown in xref:img-calculated-from-a-map[xrefstyle="short"].

NOTE: This calculation was only to determine a new set of coordinates based on offsets from a known set of coordinates. The parameters Coordinate Precision, Radial of Feature, Measurement Error, and Distance Precision were irrelevant to this calculation.
