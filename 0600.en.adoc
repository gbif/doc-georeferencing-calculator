== Calculating Coordinates from a Map

*Georeferences* for every *locality type* require *coordinates*. For all of the *locality types* except "_Coordinates only_" and "_Distance along path_", the *coordinates* of the *corrected center* of the reference *feature* are needed. In many cases these can be determined directly from a *gazetteer* or from an online tool such as Google Maps™. If the *coordinates* of a *feature* need to be determined from other reference points that have *coordinates* on a map (such as the corners), there is a nice little trick that can be done with the *_Georeferencing Calculator_* to determine the *coordinates* of the *feature* easily. For example, to *georeference* the *locality* "10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield", first determine the *coordinates* for "Bakersfield". Suppose the _Coordinate Source_ is the USGS Gosford 1:24,000 Quad map. Once the *corrected center* of Bakersfield has been determined on the map, find a convenient spot on the map having known *coordinates*, such as the corner nearest to the feature. In this case, the northeast corner of the map is closest and marked with the *coordinates* 35° 22′ 30″ N, 119° 00′ W.

To begin the calculation, select the _Locality Type_ "_Distance along orthogonal directions_" (because the measurement is due south and due west from the northeast corner of the map to the *corrected center* of Bakersfield). Next, select "_degrees minutes seconds_" as the _Coordinate Format_. Enter the *coordinates* of the known point (the northeast corner of the map, in this example) into the _Input Latitude_ and _Longitude_ fields (35° 22′ 30″ N, 119° 0′ 0′ W – don't neglect the hemisphere indicators). Select "_North American Datum 1927_" as the _Datum_ used by the map.

Now use a measuring tool (_e.g._, a ruler) to measure a) the distance between the northeast corner of the map and the line of *latitude* of the *corrected center* of Bakersfield where it meets the east edge of the map, and b) the distance between the northeast corner of the map and the line of *longitude* of the *corrected center* of Bakersfield where it meets the north edge of the map. These are the orthogonal distances to the S and W of the known point, the northeast corner of the map.

NOTE: Convert all measurements made on the maps (mm, cm, or inches) into the distance unit provided in the locality (miles, in this example). Use the *Scale Converter* at the bottom of the Calculator, to do this calculation (see <<coordinate-distance-and-scale-converters>>).

The point we have determined to be the *corrected center* of Bakersfield is 8 mm south of the 35° N line of *latitude* and 67 mm west of the 119° W line of *longitude*. After the _Scale Converter_ has been used to convert millimeters to miles, cut and paste the values for miles into the _Offset Distance_ text boxes on the right side of the *_Calculator_*: 0.1193 should be pasted or typed into the _North or South Offset Distance_ field, and the cardinal direction drop-down should be set to "_S_" (south); 0.99916 should be pasted or typed into the _East or West Offset Distance_ field, and the cardinal direction drop-down should be set to "_W_" (west). The _Distance Units_ drop-down should display "_mi_" (miles), since that is the unit described in the *locality*. The *_Calculator_* now has all of the parameters necessary to complete the calculation and should appear as in xref:img-calculate-from-a-map[xrefstyle="short"].

Next, click the _Calculate_ button. The calculated *coordinates* (always in *decimal degrees*) for the *corrected center* of Bakersfield are displayed in blue in the _Output Latitude_ and _Longitude_ fields in the results section of the *_Calculator_*, as shown in xref:img-calculated-from-a-map[xrefstyle="short"].

NOTE: This calculation was only to determine a new set of coordinates based on offsets from a known set of coordinates. The parameters *Coordinate Precision*, *Radial of Feature*, *Measurement Error*, and *Distance Precision* were irrelevant to this calculation.
