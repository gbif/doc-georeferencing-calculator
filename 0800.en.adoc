== Coordinate, Distance, and Scale Converters

The Calculator has three converters built in to eliminate the need for additional tools during the <<georeference,georeferencing>> process. Built into the parameters section of the Calculator is a converter to change the format of <<coordinates>> between three <<geographic-coordinate>> options: <<decimal-degrees>>, degrees decimal minutes, and degrees minutes seconds.

To convert between coordinate formats, simply select the desired format from the _Coordinate Format_ drop-down list. The text and drop-down boxes for the _Input Latitude_ and _Longitude_ will change and be populated with the values in the new format. For <<coordinate-system,coordinate systems>> other than geographic coordinates (e.g. <<UTM>>), a coordinate transformation into geographic coordinates will have to be done to use the Georeferencing Calculator.

Below the _Calculate_ section of the Calculator is a _Distance Converter_. To convert a distance from one unit to another, put the value and units in the text and drop-down boxes in the _Distance Converter_, to the left of the "=". The value in the units of the drop-down box will appear in blue in the text box with the grey background on the right side of the "=". For example, to convert 10 miles into kilometers, enter "_10_" in the first field of the _Distance Converter_, select "_mi_" from the left-hand unit drop-down list, and select "_km_" from the right-hand unit drop-down list. The result, "_16.09344_", automatically appears in the right-hand text box. This value can be copied and placed into a distance field in the input area of the Calculator or elsewhere (see xref:img-distance-conversion[xrefstyle="short"]).

Below the _Distance Converter_ is a _Scale Converter_ designed to convert a measurement on a map of a given scale to a real-world distance in another unit. To convert a distance measured on a map with a known scale into a distance on the ground, put the distance value, distance units, and map scale in the text and drop-down boxes in the _Scale Converter_, to the left of the "=". The value in the units of the drop-down box to the right of the "=" will appear in blue in the text box with the grey background on the right side of the "=". For example, to convert a map measurement of 8 centimeters on a 1:50000 map into miles on the ground, enter "_8_" in the first field of the _Scale Converter_, select "_cm_" from the left-hand unit drop-down list, select "_1:50000_" in the second drop-down list, containing scales, and select "_mi_" from the right-hand unit drop-down list. The result, "_2.48548_", automatically appears in the right-hand text box. This value can be copied and placed into a distance field in the input area of the Calculator or elsewhere (see xref:img-scale-conversion[xrefstyle="short"]).
