=== Step 1: Choose a Language

Click on the drop-down in the upper left-hand corner of the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Calculator^] to choose the language for the interface. When the list is expanded, the application should appear as in xref:img-choose-language[xrefstyle="short"].

NOTE: The number format always uses the full stop '.' as the decimal indicator (e.g. 2.5 for the number halfway between 2 and 3), regardless of the selected language.

=== Step 2: Choose a Locality Type

Click on the xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] drop-down to expand the list. When the list is expanded, the application should appear as in xref:img-choose-locality-type[xrefstyle="short"].

[#img-choose-locality-type]
.Step 2: Choose a locality type. The Calculator with the six basic locality types showing after opening the Locality Type drop-down list.
image::img/web/choose-locality-type.png[width=624,align="center"]

Select the xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] that best matches the characteristics of the <<locality>> to be georeferenced. Each xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] in the drop-down list shows an example to try to help match the locality to a <<locality-type,locality type>> using the pattern shown. Locality types with more examples are described in the {gqg}[Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide (Zermoglio et al. 2020)^].

=== Step 3: Enter Parameters

After selecting the xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element], a variety of text boxes, drop-down boxes, and buttons will appear on the Calculator (xref:img-enter-parameters[xrefstyle="short"]). These text and drop-down boxes need to be filled and/or values selected to make the calculation of the selected xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element]. If no parameters are entered, then the default values will be used automatically.

[#img-enter-parameters]
.Step 3: Enter parameters. The Calculator after selecting the "Distance at a heading" xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element], with all of the relevant text and drop-down boxes needed to be filled in or selected correctly in order to do a georeference calculation.

=== Step 4: Calculate

The xref:ui-calculate[role=ui-element] button appears after a xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] is selected. After all the parameters are correctly chosen or entered, click the xref:ui-calculate[role=ui-element] button. The calculated results will fill the text boxes with grey backgrounds in the middle of the Calculator, below the buttons and above the converters.

.Calculation Example
====
Suppose the <<locality>> to be <<georeference,georeferenced>> is "10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield", as shown in the example in selection box for the "[ui-element]#Distance at a heading#" xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] (for details about this type of locality see {gqg}#offset-distance-at-a-heading[Offset – Distance at a Heading^] in {gqg}[Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide (Zermoglio et al. 2020)^]). Next, suppose the <<coordinates>> for Bakersfield (35° 22′ 24″ N, 119° 1′ 4″ W) were obtained by determining the centre of town to the nearest second using a USGS Gosford 1:24,000 Quad map.

To begin, select "_USGS map: 1:24,000_" from the xref:ui-coordinate-source[role=ui-element] drop-down. Next, select "[ui-element]#degrees minutes seconds#" from the xref:ui-coordinate-format[role=ui-element] drop-down. Next, enter the coordinates for Bakersfield in the xref:ui-input-latitude[role=ui-element] and xref:ui-input-longitude[role=ui-element] boxes that appear after selecting the _Coordinate Format_. Make certain to select the correct hemisphere from the drop-downs to the right of each coordinate field.

NOTE: For this example, the <<coordinate-format,Coordinate Format>> "[ui-element]#degrees minutes seconds#" was selected because the USGS map showed coordinates in degrees minutes seconds, thus the coordinates determined for the centre of Bakersfield were described in the same way. In some cases, coordinates on a map, or other resource, may be represented in degrees decimal minutes (e.g. 35° 22′ N, 119° 0′ W or 35° 22.4′ N, 119° 1.066667′ W) or as decimal degrees (e.g. 35.3733333, −119.0177778). The Coordinate Format selected in the Calculator MUST reflect the coordinate format used on the map or other resource.

The Gosford Quad map uses the North American 1927 horizontal <<datum>>, so select "[ui-element]#North American Datum 1927#" from the xref:ui-datum[role=ui-element] drop-down list. In most cases the datum can be found printed on the map, although sometimes an <<ellipsoid>> is listed instead. The Calculator also includes ellipsoids in the _Datum_ drop-down list. If a resource, such as a map with a datum, is not listed in the Calculator, try to find the ellipsoid for that datum using online resources such as http://epsg.io[epsg.io^] and then select the appropriate ellipsoid in the _Datum_ drop-down list.

The coordinates in this example have been specified to the nearest second, so select "[ui-element]#nearest second#" from the xref:ui-input-coordinate-precision[role=ui-element] drop-down list. The direction given in the locality description is E (east), so select "[ui-element]#E#" in the xref:ui-direction[role=ui-element] drop-down list. The <<offset>> distance is 10 mi (miles), so type "_10_" into the [ui-element]#Offset Distance# text box and select "[ui-element]#miles#" from the xref:ui-distance-units[role=ui-element] drop-down list.

Bakersfield is a large place, and we don't know if the original locality means 10 miles from the center of town, 10 miles from the city limits, or something else entirely. Given that it is 3 miles from the specified coordinates to the furthest edge of town (as measured on the USGS map), the xref:ui-radial-of-feature[role=ui-element] should be 3 miles (see {gqg}#feature-with-av-obvious-spatial-extent[Feature – with an Obvious Spatial Extent^] in the {gqg}[Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide^]). Enter "_3_" into the xref:ui-radial-of-feature[role=ui-element] text field, since the units of the <<radial>> must be in the same units as the offset.

NOTE: If this distance had been measured in kilometres the value should be converted to miles using the [ui-element]#Distance Converter# at the bottom of the Calculator. The converted number should then be entered into the appropriate field (see <<converters>> to learn how to use the converters). All distance measurements MUST be in the same units as the locality description for the Calculator to return proper results.

The determination of the coordinates for Bakersfield is only as <<accuracy,accurate>> as the tools that are used; the map, the size of the units on the measurement tool, and the georeferencer's ability to place a marker relative to items on the map. Any error associated with the map itself is accounted for in the xref:ui-coordinate-source[role=ui-element] selection. Error associated with the georeferencer's ability to measure on the map is accounted for in the xref:ui-measurement-error[role=ui-element] field.

To complete the xref:ui-measurement-error[role=ui-element] field, the smallest distance that can be measured on the map reliably and repeatedly must be determined. Generally, features or locations can be distinguished on a map to within about one (1) millimetre, given a ruler with millimetre divisions. If a ruler with English units is used, it may be possible to distinguish to 1/16th of an inch. The quality of the measuring tool, eyesight, and technique may alter these suggested values.

Once the smallest distance that can be measured consistently and reliably has been determined, enter that value and its units into the [ui-element]#Scale Converter# at the bottom of the Calculator, select the scale of the map used for the measurement, and then select the unit of measure into which the conversion should be made. For example, if a digital measuring tool was used to measure to the nearest 0.1 mm on a 1:24000 map and this needs to be converted to miles, enter "_0.1_" into the xref:ui-radial-of-feature[role=ui-element], then select "[ui-element]#mm#" from the units drop-down list. Next, choose the "_1:24000_" scale option in the map scale drop-down list. Finally, select "[ui-element]#mi#" in the second drop-down list. The value of 0.1 mm at 1:24000 converted into miles will be displayed in blue ("_0.00149 mi_") within the grey text box on the right side of the [ui-element]#Scale Converter#. Type "_0.00149_" into the xref:ui-measurement-error[role=ui-element] field, or move it from the _Scale Converter_ using copy and paste keyboard combinations.

Next, make certain that "[ui-element]#mi#" is selected in the xref:ui-distance-units[role=ui-element] drop-down, since the locality is described in miles ("10 mi E…"). The offset component in this locality is 10 mi, which is <<precision,precise>> to the nearest 10 miles (see the discussion on this topic in the section {gbp}#uncertainty-related-to-offset-precision[Uncertainty Related to Offset Precision^] in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^]. Select "_10 mi_" in the distance [ui-element]#Precision# drop-down.

Next, click the xref:ui-calculate[role=ui-element] button. The calculated coordinates (always presented in <<decimal-degrees>>) for the locality "10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield" and the xref:ui-uncertainty[role=ui-element] for the calculation (always in meters) will be given in the controls just above the [ui-element]#Distance Converter# at the lower part of the Calculator, as shown in xref:img-calculate[xrefstyle="short"].

.Step 4: Calculate. The Calculator after clicking on the Calculate button, with all of the relevant text and drop-down boxes filled in or selected for an example of locality type "Distance at a heading". Results appear written in blue in the grey text boxes in the middle section of the Calculator below the Calculate button.
image::img/web/calculate.png[width=624,align="center"]

=== Step 5: Enter Metadata

After the results of the calculation have been presented, add the name of the georeferencer in the [ui-element]#Georeferenced by# text box. If there is more than one person, separate the names in the list by ' | '. Finally, select the appropriate <<georeference,georeferencing>> [ui-element]#Protocol#. We recommend the {gqg}[Georeferencing Quick Referencing Guide (Zermoglio et al. 2020)^] as the <<georeferencing-protocol>> to follow and select. Do not use this option if the protocol was altered in any way. Rather, make a citable document available and reference that. People will rely on strict application of the georeferencing protocol in order to be able to reproduce a georeference given the same input parameters. If an undocumented protocol is followed, select "[ui-element]#protocol not recorded#". The example georeference from xref:img-calculate[xrefstyle="short"], with the metadata filled in, is shown in xref:img-enter-metadata[xrefstyle="short"].

[#img-enter-metadata]
.Step 5: Enter Metadata. The Calculator after entering an example of georeference metadata for the georeferencer and the georeferencing Protocol used.

=== Step 6: Copy Results

The results (in blue in the middle section of the Calculator after clicking on the xref:ui-calculate[role=ui-element] button), including the metadata, can be copied onto the system clipboard by clicking on the [ui-element]#Copy# button, after which a dialog box will appear displaying the content that has been copied, as shown in xref:img-copy-results[xrefstyle="short"].

NOTE: This dialog box does not get translated based on the language chosen for the Calculator interface. To close the box, click the [ui-element]#OK# button. Once copied, the content can be transferred and pasted to a spreadsheet, database or text file as a tab-delimited record of the data for the current calculation.

[#img-copy-results]
.Step 6: Copy Results. Pop-up dialog box after clicking on the Copy button, showing the tab-delimited results of the example georeference that have been copied to the system clipboard.
image::img/web/copy-results.png[width=329,align="center"]

=== Step 7: Paste Results

The content on the system clipboard after clicking on the [ui-element]#Copy# button is tab-delimited. It can be pasted into a series of columns of a spreadsheet directly (this works in Excel as well as Google Sheets). It can also be pasted into a tab-delimited text file. When pasting the results, be certain that the order of the fields in the destination document matches the order of the fields in the results. Using http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/[Darwin Core standard term names^] (see also https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029715[Wieczorek et al. 2012^]), the order of the result fields is:

* term:dwc[decimalLatitude]
* term:dwc[decimalLongitude]
* term:dwc[geodeticDatum]
* term:dwc[coordinateUncertaintyInMeters]
* term:dwc[coordinatePrecision]
* term:dwc[georeferencedBy]
* term:dwc[georeferencedDate]
* term:dwc[georeferenceProtocol]

Note that only the values are copied and can be pasted, and not the corresponding headers. xref:img-paste-results[xrefstyle="short"] shows the results after being pasted into a cell in a Google Sheet.

[#img-paste-results]
.Step 7: Paste Results. Part of a Google Sheet into which the results have been pasted. The column names reflecting Darwin Core terms were already in row 1 when the results were pasted into the cell A2.
image::img/web/paste-results.png[width=624,align="center"]

=== Step 8: Start a New Calculation

A new calculation can be started simply by entering new parameter values and selecting new drop-down list values pertinent to the next calculation. If the xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] for the next calculation is different from the previous one, make a new selection on the xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] drop-down list. New parameters will appear that are relevant to the new xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element] calculation. Previously entered and chosen values will remain in the text and drop-down boxes and thus carry over to the next calculation whenever possible. This can increase the efficiency of calculations if <<locality>> descriptions that include the same feature are <<georeference,georeferenced>> one after another.

NOTE: Always check that all parameter values and choices are correct before accepting the results of a calculation. xref:img-new-calculation[xrefstyle="short"] shows the Calculator after selecting the xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element]: [ui-element]#Geographic feature only# for a new georeference following the georeference calculation shown in xref:img-enter-metadata[xrefstyle="short"]. Without doing anything further, the Calculator would be ready to calculate the georeference for the locality "Bakersfield" based on the previous entries. Note that the [ui-element]#Date# value will change automatically when the xref:ui-calculate[role=ui-element] button is clicked.

[#img-new-calculation]
.Step 8: Start a New Calculation. The Calculator after selecting a new Locality Type to start a new georeference calculation following the calculation from xref:img-enter-metadata[xrefstyle="short"]. Note that there are fewer parameters to enter for this Locality Type, and that the relevant parameter values that were in the previous calculation are preserved for this calculation.
