== Running the Calculator

The *_Georeferencing Calculator_* uses JavaScript and runs in a browser. The latest version can be initiated from http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html, or it can be downloaded in a .zip or .tar.gz archive from the https://github.com/VertNet/georefcalculator/releases[releases page] on the *_Calculator_* GitHub repository, unzipped to a convenient location and run in a browser by opening the file gc.html. Problems encountered with the *_Calculator_* should be entered as issues in the https://github.com/VertNet/georefcalculator/issues[GitHub repository issue tracker] and should include the version identifier, which can be found in the lower right-hand corner of the *_Calculator_* (see xref:img-screen-image[xrefstyle="short"]). When the *_Calculator_* is opened it should appear as shown in xref:img-screen-image[xrefstyle="short"].
